# Create a file called f_to_c.py. In it, create a function called conv_f_to_c() that accepts 
# the temperature in Fahrenheit and returns the Celsius equivalent. 
# You will be able to call the function using code similar to the following: 
# current_temp_F = ___ 
# current_temp_C = conv_f_to_c(current_temp_F) 
# Use the function to convert the following Fahrenheit values and display them in 
# Celsius (rounded to the nearest whole degree): 
# ∗ 212 
# ∗ 90 
# ∗ 72 
# ∗ 32 
# ∗ 0 
# ∗ -40
